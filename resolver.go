// Resolver fetches the source text of a stylesheet referenced by xsl:include or

// URI of the referencing stylesheet module (empty for the top-level stylesheet).
// It returns the referenced stylesheet source and the base URI to associate with
// it (used to resolve hrefs nested inside the returned stylesheet).
//
// The seam keeps compilation free of any filesystem or network dependency: a
// stylesheet bundle can be resolved entirely in memory (see MapResolver) or from
// disk with a small [ResolverFunc]. When a stylesheet references xsl:include or
// xsl:import and no Resolver is configured, compilation fails with a clear error
// rather than silently dropping the reference.
